Stopwatch RTOS
==============
This program is for a stopwatch with button inputs and seven segment display outputs that utilizes block random access memory (BRAM) and a real-time operating system (RTOS) called FreeRTOS for ELEN 423 Embedded Systems using an Artix-7 FPGA. The RTOS is used to manage each individual task and have them execute at the appropriate time for the purposes of maintaining accuracy.
